    h2 FAQ

    h3 How did you pick which sites to test with?

    p.
      We tried to use the most popular sites in each category
      according to
      their <a href="http://www.alexa.com/topsites">Alexa
      rating</a>. If there is a filter in place, it should at
      least spot these sites.

    p.
            We require sites that have
            a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon">favicon</a>
            since browsers allow us to fetch them from arbitrary
            domains and check that we received a valid image. Filters
            may return 404s, 403s, DNS errors, or return a HTML 'this
            is blocked' page. By fetching a favicon we can detect all
            these possibilities.

    p.
            Where possible, we use HTTPS addresses. This allows us to
            eliminate filters that forbid 'http://bad.example.com/'
            but allow 'http://bad.example.com/favicon.ico', since it
            is <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/144879/does-https-encrypt-urls-too">not
            possible for routers to see the path over HTTPS
            connections</a>.

    h3 Can users evade a filter?

    p.
            Yes. There are many approaches, so we only cover the two
            most common approaches here.

    p.
            There are many websites
            (e.g. <a href="http://www.hidemyass.com/proxy/">[1]</a>
            <a href="http://www.webproxy.ca/">[2]</a>) available that
            enable you to circumvent filtering. Of course, some
            filters also block web proxies. There is a cat-and-mouse
            game between filter tools and online proxies, and the
            filter tools frequently lose. Users only need to find one
            accessible proxy, whereas a filter tool must block all of
            them, with new proxies appearing often.

    p.
            You can also connect to the Internet through a VPN
            provider (e.g. <a href="http://www.purevpn.com/">[1]</a>
            <a href="http://www.strongvpn.com/">[2]</a>). Using a VPN,
            your local ISP cannot see what websites you are accessing,
            so cannot filter.

    h3 Does a filter catch everything?

    p.
      No. New sites are created every day, and filters
      are forever catching up. Some filters may add
      websites to their blackists automatically, but
      automatic tools are not perfect.

    h3 What are the consequence of an internet service with a filter?

    p.
      A filter has to inspect every website accessed, which necessarily
      makes surfing slower. Any bugs in the filter may stop sites
      working, or even prevent access to acceptable sites.

    h3 What does a good filter look like?

    p.
      A good filter should be clear that a site is being blocked,
      rather than returning a generic error. It should be easy to
      test whether or not the filter is working (for antivirus tools
      there is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EICAR_test_file">EICAR
      test file</a>.

    h3 How do I protect children online?

    p.
      A pure technology solution will never work perfectly. The best
      approach is to supervise children as they surf, to ensure
      they access content appropriate for their age.

    h3 Where can I get more information on filtering?

    p.
      <a href="https://opennet.net/">The OpenNet Initiative</a>
      tracks Internet filtering globally.

    h3 I run a site with adult content. How do I prevent children accessing it?

    p.
        There was <a href="http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-discuss/2006-December/007909.html">a
        proposal for a microformat</a>, but no standard has emerged. The most common solution
        seems to be a clickthrough warning on the home page on adult sites.    

    h3 Where do I report bugs on this site?

    p.
        Please file bugs <a href="https://github.com/Wilfred/is_my_internet_filtered/issues">on
        the GitHub project.
