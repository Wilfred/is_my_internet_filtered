      h2 FAQ

      h3 How did you pick which sites to test with?

      p.
        We tried to use the most popular sites in each category
        according to
        their <a href="http://www.alexa.com/topsites">Alexa
        rating</a>. If there is a filter in place, it should at
        least spot these sites.

      p.
              We require sites that have
              a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon">favicon</a>
              since browsers allow us to fetch them from arbitrary
              domains and check that we received a valid image. Filters
              may return 404s, 403s, DNS errors, or return a HTML 'this
              is blocked' page. By fetching a favicon we can detect all
              these possibilities.

      p.
              Where possible, we use HTTPS addresses. This allows us to
              eliminate filters that forbid 'http://bad.example.com/'
              but allow 'http://bad.example.com/favicon.ico', since it
              is <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/144879/does-https-encrypt-urls-too">not
              possible for routers to see the path over HTTPS
              connections</a>.

      h3 Can users evade a filter?

      p.
              Yes. There are many approaches, so we only cover the two
              most common approaches here.

      p.
              There are many websites
              (e.g. <a href="http://www.hidemyass.com/proxy/">[1]</a>
              <a href="http://www.webproxy.ca/">[2]</a>) available that
              enable you to circumvent filtering. Of course, some
              filters also block web proxies. There is a cat-and-mouse
              game between filter tools and online proxies, and the
              filter tools frequently lose. Users only need to find one
              accessible proxy, whereas a filter tool must block all of
              them, with new proxies appearing often.

      p.
              You can also connect to the Internet through a VPN
              provider (e.g. <a href="http://www.purevpn.com/">[1]</a>
              <a href="http://www.strongvpn.com/">[2]</a>). Using a VPN,
              your local ISP cannot see what websites you are accessing,
              so cannot filter.

      h3 Does a filter catch everything?

      p.
        No. New sites are created every day, and filters
        are forever catching up. Some filters may add
        websites to their blacklists automatically, but
        automatic tools are not perfect.

      h3 What are the consequence of an internet service with a filter?

      p.
        A filter has to inspect every website accessed, which necessarily
        makes surfing slower. Any bugs in the filter may stop sites
        working, or even prevent access to acceptable sites.

      h3 What does a good filter look like?

      p.
        A good filter should be clear that a site is being blocked,
        rather than returning a generic error. It should be easy to
        test whether or not the filter is working (for antivirus tools
        there is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EICAR_test_file">EICAR
        test file</a>.

      h3 How do I protect children online?

      p.
        A pure technology solution will never work perfectly. The best
        approach is to supervise children as they surf, to ensure
        they access content appropriate for their age.

      h3 Where can I get more information on filtering?

      p.
        <a href="https://opennet.net/">The OpenNet Initiative</a>
        tracks Internet filtering globally.

      h3 I run a site with adult content. How do I prevent children accessing it?

      p.
          There was <a href="http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-discuss/2006-December/007909.html">a
          proposal for a microformat</a>, but no standard has emerged. The most common solution
          seems to be a clickthrough warning on the home page on adult sites.    

      h3 Where do I report bugs on this site?

      p.
          Please file bugs <a href="https://github.com/Wilfred/is_my_internet_filtered/issues">on
          the GitHub project.
