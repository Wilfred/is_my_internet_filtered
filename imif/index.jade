    h2 FAQ

    h3 How did you pick which sites to test with?

    p.
      We tried to use the most popular sites in each category
      according to
      their <a href="http://www.alexa.com/topsites">Alexa
      rating</a>. If there is a filter in place, it should at
      least spot these sites.

    p.
            We require sites that have
            a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon">favicon</a>
            since browsers allow us to fetch them from arbitrary
            domains and check that we received a valid image. Filters
            may return 404s, 403s, DNS errors, or return a HTML 'this
            is blocked' page. By fetching a favicon we can detect all
            these possibilities.

    p.
            Where possible, we use HTTPS addresses. This allows us to
            eliminate filters that forbid 'http://bad.example.com/'
            but allow 'http://bad.example.com/favicon.ico', since it
            is <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/144879/does-https-encrypt-urls-too">not
            possible for routers to see the path over HTTPS
            connections</a>.

    h3 Can users evade a filter?

    p.
            Yes. There are many approaches, so we only cover the two
            most common approaches here.

    p.
            There are many websites
            (e.g. <a href="http://www.hidemyass.com/proxy/">[1]</a>
            <a href="http://www.webproxy.ca/">[2]</a>) available that
            enable you to circumvent filtering. Of course, some
            filters also block web proxies. There is a cat-and-mouse
            game between filter tools and online proxies, and the
            filter tools frequently lose. Users only need to find one
            accessible proxy, whereas a filter tool must block all of
            them, with new proxies appearing often.

    p.
            You can also connect to the Internet through a VPN
            provider (e.g. <a href="http://www.purevpn.com/">[1]</a>
            <a href="http://www.strongvpn.com/">[2]</a>). Using a VPN,
            your local ISP cannot see what websites you are accessing,
            so cannot filter.

    h3 Does a filter catch everything?

    p No.

    h3 What are the costs of running a filter?

    h3 What does a good filter look like?

    h3 How do I protect children online?

    h3 Where can I get more information on filtering?

    p.
      <a href="https://opennet.net/">The OpenNet Initiative</a>
      tracks Internet filtering globally.

    h3 I run a site with adult content. How do I prevent children accessing it?

    p.
        There was <a href="http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-discuss/2006-December/007909.html">a
        proposal for a microformat</a>, but no standard has emerged. The most common solution
        seems to be a clickthrough warning on the home page on adult sites.    

    h3 Where do I report bugs on this site?

    p.
        Please file bugs <a href="https://github.com/Wilfred/is_my_internet_filtered/issues">on
        the GitHub project.
